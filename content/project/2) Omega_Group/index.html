<h1>Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination</h1>
<p>The data we are going to analyze is of employees in Omega Group Plc., a large multinational company. The objective is to find out if the employees are facing gender-based salary discrimination.</p>
<!-- At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted.  -->
<!-- You are asked to carry out the analysis. The objective is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor.  -->

<h2>Exploratory data analysis</h2>

<p>It can be observed that the dataset contains data of more female employees than male employees. On average, the experience and salary of males is higher than that of females.</p>
<p>Observing the scatterplot between experience and salary by gender closely -</p>
<pre class="r"><code>omega %&gt;% 
  
  #Scatterplot between salary and experience
  ggplot(aes(x=experience, y=salary, col=gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  
  #Black and white theme
  theme_bw() +
  
  #Putting title and axes labels
  labs(title = &quot;Scatterplot between Salary and Experience&quot;,
       x = &quot;Number of years of work experience&quot;,
       y = &quot;Salary&quot;,
       color = &quot;Gender&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/salary_exp_scatter-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We can observe that salary and work experience are positively correlated. As the number of years of work experience increase, salary increases on average. This relation holds true for males as well as females. However, many women executives have experience less than 5 years and several even have zero year. This means Omega just started to include women in their workforce, while experience of male executives are more evenly distributed.</p>

<p>We observe that the 95% confidence intervals for mean salaries of both genders are not overlapping. Hence, we can conclude that there is a significant difference between the population means of salaries of males and females.</p>

<p>By conducting this t-test, it can be concluded that the null hypothesis can be rejected at 95% confidence level as the p-value is less than 0.05. We can conclude that there is a significant difference between the population means of salaries of males and females.</p>
<p>However, there is a possibility that this statistically significant difference between the mean salaries of males and females could be attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. Hence, we compare the relationship between experience and gender.</p>

<p>The correlation between experience and salary is very high (0.803) and it is statistically significant at 95% confidence level as the p-value is less than 0.05.</p>
<p>The conclusion that there is a statistically significant difference between the mean experience of males and females endangers our previous one about the difference in male and female salaries. The statistically significant difference in salaries of males and females cannot be attributed just to gender, as there is also a significant difference between the mean experience of males and females. A combination of factors could be the reason of the difference between salaries between males and females.</p>
